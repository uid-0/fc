One fine day, you're strolling down the main arcology promenade, making your usual combined inspection and public rounds. These walks are triply useful, since they allow you to keep a finger on the pulse of your demesne, identify any problems, and display yourself to the population.

Your personal assistant suddenly relays a silent alarm, highlighting a scruffy individual twenty meters ahead. This person is hooded and acting oddly. You catch a glance from beneath the hood in your direction: and the figure obviously decides that it can get no closer to you. Your assistant's scanning detects the presence of an implanted bomb moments before the suicide bomber detonates themselves.

The implanted bomb is small, and went off too far ahead to do anything more than stun. Three other assailants run at you from where they were waiting in the confusion, wielding improvised weapons that apparently did not set off the security scanners. Without a bodyguard, decent security systems, or any other means of personal defense, you meet your ignominious death at the end of a bludgeon fashioned from a maintenance tool.
