//The Slavegirl School is the newest slave school operating in the Free Cities. Its business model is to offer simpler, cheaper wares than its competitors. All Slavegirl School graduates are natural-born females without surgical modifications. Their training emphasizes elimination of any serious psychological deformities. They are promptly enslaved and sold as soon as they reach their majorities, and are marketed as complete virgins.//

The Slavegirl School offers a fresh graduate for inspection via video call.
