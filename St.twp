//St. Claver Preparatory is an old world preparatory school that was purchased by an old world medical school adapting to the demand for plastic surgeons from the Free Cities. It functions as a standard slave school until its students near graduation. At that point they are paired with a budding plastic surgeon. Intensive, flawless, and of course successful surgical modification of the student is required to complete certification as a Free Cities plastic surgeon of the top rank. All St. Claver's graduates are modified to a single exacting standard. Meanwhile, the slave school is free to train its students for obedience and sexual conformity.//

St. Claver Preparatory offers a fresh graduate for inspection via video call.
