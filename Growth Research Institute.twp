//The Growth Research Institute (GRI) is not primarily a slave school at all, but rather the world leader in female growth hormone development. It operates research centers in the Free Cities to avoid traditional medical research laws. GRI runs several slave schools to raise healthy, unmodified subjects for use in trials. After a year of experimental hormone treatment they are sold as graduates.//

GRI offers a fresh graduate for inspection via video call.
